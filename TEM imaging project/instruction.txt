I have a task for you. It is iteractive and interactive, meaning that you should feel free to decline/discuss/amend it, that there is a tree of subtasks, each being valuable, and that each subtask can be refined in the process. If you take it, I expect you to do it speedily, as an example of your productivity that we could demonstrate at a group meeting. Every new group member goes through a trial. The sooner you get through yours, the better. I’ll skip some details for brevity. Aim for a code that can be presented in real time. All x-y plots should be neat (boxed, with clearly readable symbols; suitable for Nature-level publication; Barbaros is sensitive to this). 
Import a cleaned-up planview TEM image of MAC, like the attached examples. Make its digital map comprising connected nodes. Then 
Task 1: Plot a 2D Fourier transform. Restore the length scale and compare it with the experimental one, if exists. This can be done, e.g., by detecting (unstrained) 6-membered rings, averaging their bond length, and comparing it with graphene. 
Task 2: Identify the number of carbons per ring, colour those rings, and plot their histogram.  
Task 3: Analyse the connectivity with multiple models, like 100% sp2, 100% sp3 and intermediates. In all models take it for granted that each node can have an invisible C-H bond. The selection criteria will be the combination of bond angle, connectivity and bond length. For each model, count the hydrogen concentration. 
Task 4: For each model, plot a 3D image. Determine its average height. Plot the distribution of bond lengths and angles. 
Details will be rectified in the process. I would use a smart algorithm rather than brute force. Example: start with identifying 6-membered rings and unusual nodes, like those with 2 or 4 bonds, symmetric -C≡C- or =C-C= nodes, etc. Image edges should be discarded somehow.
